# To run in desktop app, open in android studio, click on edit configurations, click on the plus sign on the top left corner, select application, on top where it says name rename to "Desktop", on the 'main class' select the small '3 dotted bar' on the right side and type desktop and select desktoplauncher. Lastly in 'working directory' select the assets folder withing the project. This should make the application run on desktop. Happy Experimenting! :]
